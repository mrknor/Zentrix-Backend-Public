## Core Controllers

### AccountController

The `AccountController` manages all account-related functionality, including registration, login, and profile management.

- **Registration & Login**: Uses secure methods to authenticate users.
- **Profile Management**: Updates user information.

**Snippet: Handling Registration**
```csharp
[HttpPost("register")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Register(UserRegistrationDto userDto)
{
    var result = await _accountService.Register(userDto);
    if (result.Success)
        return Ok(result);
    return BadRequest(result.Message);
}
```

### ChatController

The `ChatController` leverages OpenAI to facilitate a chatbot that responds to user inquiries about trading.

**Snippet: Sending Chat Messages to OpenAI**
```csharp
[HttpPost("send")]
public async Task<IActionResult> SendMessage(ChatMessageDto message)
{
    var response = await _chatService.GenerateResponse(message);
    return Ok(response);
}
```

This integration with OpenAI API provides meaningful answers, creating an interactive experience for users.

### EmailController

The `EmailController` sends notifications and signals through emails, using the SMTP server configuration.

**Snippet: Sending Email Notifications**
```csharp
[HttpPost("send")]
public async Task<IActionResult> SendEmail(EmailRequest request)
{
    var result = await _emailSender.SendEmailAsync(request);
    return result ? Ok("Email sent successfully") : BadRequest("Email failed to send");
}
```

### PaperTradesController

Handles individual simulated trades, allowing users to practice trading strategies in a paper trading environment.

**Snippet: Executing a Paper Trade**
```csharp
[HttpPost("execute")]
public async Task<IActionResult> ExecuteTrade(PaperTradeRequest tradeRequest)
{
    var tradeResult = await _paperTradesService.ExecuteTrade(tradeRequest);
    return Ok(tradeResult);
}
```

### PaperTradingAccountController

This controller manages usersâ€™ paper trading accounts, which include simulated balance management and transaction tracking.

### SignalsController

The `SignalsController` is a core part of the backend, handling signal generation and historical data management.

**Snippet: Fetching the Latest Signal**
```csharp
[HttpGet("get")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetSignal(string symbol)
{
    var signal = await _signalsService.GetLatestSignal(symbol);
    return signal != null ? Ok(signal) : NotFound("No signals available");
}
```

### StocksController

This controller retrieves live stock data from Polygon, providing real-time market insights.

**Snippet: Retrieving Stock Information**
```csharp
[HttpGet("info")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetStockInfo(string symbol)
{
    var stockInfo = await _polygonService.GetStockInfo(symbol);
    return Ok(stockInfo);
}
```

## Core Services

### ChatService

The `ChatService` integrates with OpenAI for NLP-powered responses in the chatbot. It allows users to interact with AI directly through the chatbot.

**Snippet: Generating an OpenAI Response**
```csharp
public async Task<string> GenerateResponse(ChatMessageDto message)
{
    var aiResponse = await _openAIClient.GetResponseAsync(message.Text);
    return aiResponse;
}
```

### EmailSender

This service manages email notifications for users, especially critical updates and signals. Integrates with SMTP for reliable delivery.

**Snippet: Sending Emails via SMTP**
```csharp
public async Task<bool> SendEmailAsync(EmailRequest request)
{
    // SMTP client configuration and sending logic
    return emailSuccess;
}
```

### OpenAIClient

The `OpenAIClient` handles interactions with the OpenAI API, both for chat responses and sentiment analysis.

**Snippet: Requesting an AI-Generated Response**
```csharp
public async Task<string> GetResponseAsync(string prompt)
{
    var response = await openAiApi.GetCompletionAsync(prompt);
    return response;
}
```

### PolygonService

Integrates with the Polygon API to fetch current and historical stock data, which feeds directly into signal generation and user dashboards.

**Snippet: Fetching Stock Data from Polygon**
```csharp
public async Task<StockData> GetStockInfo(string symbol)
{
    return await polygonClient.GetRealTimeStockData(symbol);
}
```

### SentimentAnalysisService

The `SentimentAnalysisService` provides sentiment scoring based on market news, aiding in signal creation and risk assessment.

**Snippet: Performing Sentiment Analysis**
```csharp
public async Task<double> AnalyzeSentiment(string text)
{
    var sentimentScore = await _openAIClient.AnalyzeSentiment(text);
    return sentimentScore;
}
```

### WebSocketManager

`WebSocketManager` enables real-time communication, pushing updates like trade signals and stock prices to connected clients.

**Snippet: Broadcasting Updates via WebSocket**
```csharp
public async Task BroadcastUpdate(string message)
{
    foreach (var socket in _sockets)
    {
        if (socket.State == WebSocketState.Open)
            await socket.SendAsync(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message), WebSocketMessageType.Text, true, CancellationToken.None);
    }
}
```

## Development Insights

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Handling OpenAI Response Delays**: Initially, the response time from OpenAI caused delays. Implementing asynchronous calls and caching responses for repeated questions improved response speed.

2. **Integrating Polygon Data Efficiently**: Due to rate limits on the Polygon API, we set up a caching system to store frequently requested data. This reduced the number of API calls, keeping data retrieval fast.

3. **Creating a Reliable WebSocket System**: Managing real-time data with WebSocket required efficient handling of client connections. We implemented `WebSocketManager` to broadcast updates only to active clients, reducing unnecessary data traffic.

4. **Sentiment Analysis Calibration**: The initial sentiment scores from OpenAI were inconsistent, so we adjusted the scoring to better align with market data. This calibration provided a more accurate reflection of market sentiment.

5. **Error Handling in Email Delivery**: Configuring the email service to retry failed deliveries enhanced the reliability of email notifications, ensuring users received critical updates without delay.
